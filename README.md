Files for HCDE410SP22 - Final Project

Welcome to the Jupyter notebook for Anna Kucinskiâ€™s Final Report for HCDE 410. The goal of this project was to investigate the data provided by the Seattle Public Library System on item checkouts, looking for patterns between historical events, holidays, and cultural/identity months. I also looked into how different media types have been checked out over time. I used this project to investigate two questions: 
* How do item subject checkouts correlate with national holidays, heritage months, or historical events?
* How have the popularity of different forms of media/items offered by the library changed over time?

This notebook includes: 
- A guided Jupiter notebook with an explanation of my project process
- A license file
- 1 CSV file with all of the summary tables I created for this project
- 1 Excel file with all of the summary tables I created for this project. 
- 1 Screenshot of the Seattle Open Data Visualization Platform I worked with to gather data.
- 1 folder of the 17 created graphics I made for this project, all of which are explained in the guided Jupyter notebook.
