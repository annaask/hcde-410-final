HCDE 410 Final Preliminary Proposal - Anna Kucinski

This project investigates the frequencies and traits of items checked out in the Seattle Public Library System. Through the use of four datasets from the Seattle Open Data Database, I will gain insights on checkout history of items in the Seattle Public Library, topics that are most and least popular, the history/frequency of  item checkouts, and how that compares to holidays and historical events. I will also be specifically investigating the traits of the books checked out, such as topic and year published.
