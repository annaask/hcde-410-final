    "I am planning on analyzing the the patterns in the checkout history of items in the Seattle Public Library. I want to see which books are most popular, least popular, and the history/frequency of  item checkouts. I may also look into other aspects that affect library checkouts, or other traits of the books that are being checked out. From a practical perspective, knowing the distribution of books that are checked out could give the library system insights into what types of books to purchase in the future, or which locations to move different types of books to. From a human-centered perspective, this information can make library layouts more effective in their placement of books on the floor. From a scientific perspective, it may provide some insights into the different times of year types/subjects of items are likely to be checked out, if there are correlations between events and items checked out, or if checkout rates increase or decrease overall between month or year.\n"

    "Library data from across the country has been collected and analyzed in many ways. The Library Research Service (LRS) from the Colorado Department of Education conducts library research and has compiled resources for library systems across the United States. Included in these resources is national survey data and analysis from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) (https://www.lrs.org/data-tools/public-libraries/national-statistics/) and individual state library agency data and analysis for all states except Arkansas (https://www.lrs.org/data-tools/public-libraries/other-states/). \n",

    "Washington State has Public Library Statistics that are accessible to the public in multiple formats, detailing various aspects of the library system like COVID-19 impact, revenue, expenditures, personel, holdings, computers, salaries, and circulation/collection use, to name a few (https://www.sos.wa.gov/library/libraries/libdev/publications.aspx#WAStats). Yearly reports are available, from 1999-2020. Additionally, the entire state, each congressional district, and each legislative district has a fact sheet with the community benefit of libraries in each region for 2018. The analysis most similar to the project I am proposing is their compilation of circulation/collection use and collection/holdings, which describe the circulation of library materials across the state of Washington and the extent of their collection. The posted data tables don't mention specific findings, but instead could serve as a data set for further analysis of each individual library's activity. \n",

    "Regarding Seattle Public Library data specifically, Yorgos Askalidis published two Medium articles analyzing this data, and explored check out trends over the year (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-and-when-people-use-the-public-library-1b102f58fd8a) and per item (https://medium.com/@yaskalidis/the-most-checked-out-books-from-the-public-library-63f147c04df3). When checking out yearly trends, Askalidis used a random sample of 10% of each year's checkout records, and found that book checkouts were consistently around 4 million per year, and that audio/visual checkouts have been declining since 2009. He also found that 4 pm was the most popular hour for checking out books and discs. Saturdays were the most popular day for check outs every year, and summers and january were popular for checkouts. When examining item trends, Askalidis determined the top 10 most checked out books and discs for 2018 and the top book and movie for 2006-2017.  Noting this previous work, I decided to investigate how traits of items, like topic and release date, affect their checkout rate over time. I will also be investigating digital media as a seperate item, unlike Askalidis.\n",

    "Melanie Walsh, of \"Tweets of a Native Son\", analyzed the SPL data set to explore the history of books checked out pertaining to or writen by James Baldwin (https://tweetsofanativeson.com/Seattle-Public-Library/). She found that there was a sharp increase in items borrowed at the end of 2016, especially for the documentary titled \"I am not your Negro\", published in 2017. With this documentary removed, she highlights the history of other items regarding James Baldwin and the correlation to the Ferguson Protests and #BlackLivesMatter. This exploration furthered my interest in comparing library data to holidays, and broadened my first research question to include historical events. "

    "For all of my research questions I will investigate the relationship between checkouts and time. so I will be performing a time series analysis to explore that data. I will sort the data into item traits and years/months/weeks checked out in order to see the number of items checked out at each point in time. For the first question, I will then compare these numbers to holidays and historical events to see if an increase or decrease in checkouts allign with the event. I will represent this through various historgrams with a timeline of relevant historical events overlayed. For the second question, I will create a histogram data visualization that overlays the number of checkouts for each type of item. My third research question will also be represented with a histogram, showing a few key years for book publishing (possibly one every 10 years), and juxtapose those histograms together. Depending on what I find, I think I may also include historgrams that leave out outliers, like books that are often read for school or that are true classics, to highlight how that changes the findings."
